The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between red and processed meat intake and obesity. We searched multiple electronic databases for observational studies on the relationship between red and processed meat intake and obesity published until July 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) and means for obesity-related indices and for variables that may contribute to heterogeneity were calculated. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted with 21 and 18 studies, respectively (n = 1,135,661). The meta-analysis (n = 113,477) showed that consumption of higher quantities of red and processed meats was a risk factor for obesity (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.14-1.64). Pooled mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) trends showed that in comparison to those in the lowest ntile, subjects in the highest ntile of red and processed meat consumption had higher BMI (mean difference: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.90-1.84 for red meat; mean difference: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.64-2.00 for processed meat) and WC (mean difference: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.86-3.70 for red meat; mean difference: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.87-2.66 for processed meat). The current analysis revealed that red and processed meat intake is directly associated with risk of obesity, and higher BMI and WC. However, the heterogeneity among studies is significant. These findings suggest a decrease in red and processed meat intake.",

In France, the prevalence of overweight in adults was 49% in 2015 (54% among men and 44% among women), including 17% of obese adults. According to the last evaluation performed by IARC in 2017, overweight and obesity are established risk factors for 13 cancer sites with risk estimates per 5kg/m2 varying largely depending on the cancer site. In 2015 in France, 5.4% of cancer cases could be attributed to excess weight, corresponding to 18,600 cases, including 3400 colon cancers, 2600 kidney cancers, 4500 breast cancers and 2500 endometrial cancers. Obesity is also related to worse prognosis for some cancers, in particular breast and colon cancers. Obesity in children and adolescents, also rising in many countries, has also been associated to an increase in adult cancer risk. A major cause of obesity is a disequilibrium in energy balance favoured by a diet rich in processed food, red meat, trans and saturated fatty acids, sweetened foods and beverages and poor in fruits and vegetables, legumes and whole grains. Main national and international recommendations to reduce the prevalence of obesity are to have a balanced diet and regular physical activity.",

Prospective studies on an association between meat consumption and BMI change are limited. We assessed the association between meat consumption and change in BMI over time in 3902 men and women aged 55-69 y from the Netherlands Cohort Study. Dietary intake was estimated at baseline using a FFQ. BMI was ascertained through baseline self-reported height (1986) and weight (1986, 1992, and 2000). Analyses were based on sex-specific categories of daily total fresh meat, red meat, beef, pork, minced meat, chicken, processed meat, and fish consumption at baseline. Linear mixed effect modeling adjusted for confounders was used to assess longitudinal associations. Significant cross-sectional differences in BMI between quintiles of total meat intake were observed (P-trend < 0.01; both sexes). No association between total fresh meat consumption and prospective BMI change was observed in men (BMI change highest vs. lowest quintile after 14 y: -0.06 kg/m²; P = 0.75) and women (BMI change: 0.26 kg/m²; P = 0.20). Men with the highest intake of beef experienced a significantly lower increase in BMI after 6 and 14 y than those with the lowest intake (BMI change after 14 y 0.60 kg/m²). After 14 y, a significantly higher increase in BMI was associated with higher intakes of pork in women (BMI change highest vs. lowest quintile: 0.47 kg/m²) and chicken in both sexes (BMI change highest vs. lowest category in both men and women: 0.36 kg/m²). The results remained similar when stratifying on median baseline BMI, and age-stratified analyses yielded mixed results. Differential BMI change effects were observed for several subtypes of meat. However, total meat consumption, or factors directly related to total meat intake, was not strongly associated with weight change during the 14-y prospective follow-up in this elderly population.",

Cooked meats contain high contents of mutagenic compounds related to CRC risk. To explore differences in meat-based carcinogen exposure, a 99-item Qualtrics survey was issued to 1648 US adults. Average monthly serving size, degree of doneness, and cooking methods of meat products were obtained. The National Cancer Institute CHARRED database was used to quantify exposure to HCAs, PAHs, and Ames Predicted and Estimated mutagenicity. Questions from validated instruments assessed food security status (FSS) and demographic variables, while height and weight were self-reported to calculate BMI. Sex, FSS and obesity status (BMI > 30 kg/m2) were compared using two-sample t-tests and multivariate regression models to determine differences in meat intake and carcinogen exposure. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Eight hundred fifty-six valid responses (57.4% female and 81.8% white) were obtained. Non-obese males consumed more white meat and were exposed to greater amounts of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline. Food insecure and obese females consumed more red meat and had higher exposure rates of several carcinogens. Pan-frying and BBQ were the primary sources of meat-derived carcinogens. Greater disparities in carcinogen exposure were observed in females regarding BMI and FSS. Public health messages to modify meat cooking methods may be most effective for CRC prevention.",

In this exploratory research, we investigated the concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors including smoking, body mass index, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake, and alcohol use within African American heterosexual couples. We also examined whether females' stress is associated with their own (actor effect) and males' cancer-related lifestyle factors (partner effect), and vice versa. We analyzed a total of 216 heterosexual couples (i.e., N = 432 individuals) recruited from black churches. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated and multilevel modeling in which individuals are nested within couples was conducted. Results showed that there was high concordance of body mass index (ICC = 1.68, p < .001), fruit and vegetable intake (ICC = 1.62, p < .001), red meat intake (ICC = 1.50, p = .001), and alcohol use (ICC = 1.74, p < .001) between spouses. A multilevel analysis showed that there were actor and partner effects of stress on females' BMI; females' stress was positively associated with their own BMI (actor effect; β = .42, p = .006) and males' stress was positively associated with females' BMI (partner effect; β = .39, p = .026). Also, females' stress was positively associated with their own red meat intake (actor effect; β = .20, p = .019). In conclusion, high concordance of cancer-related lifestyle factors (BMI, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat intake and alcohol use) exists between African American spouses. Given the identified actor and partner effects of stress on females' BMI, a couple-based lifestyle or weight management intervention that targets both male and female spouses' stress and coping will be promising, particularly to enhance African American women's health behaviors.

Data on Mongolian diets are lacking, and these risks are poorly quantified. The purpose of this study was to provide a multifaceted nutritional analysis of the modern Mongolian diet. (2) Methods: The study population consisted of 167 male and 167 female healthy non-pregnant urban and nomadic adults (22-55 years) randomly selected from lists of residents in 8 regions. From 2011-2016, 3-day weighed diet records and serum were collected twice from each participant in summer and winter; anthropometry was collected once from each participant. Serum was analyzed for biomarkers, and nutrient intake computed using purpose-built food composition data and adjusted for within-person variation. Exploratory dietary patterns were derived and analyzed for associations with diet and nutrition measurements. (3) Results: We collected 1838 of an expected 1986 diet records (92.5%), 610/658 serum samples (92.7%), and 315/334 height and weight measurements (94.3%). Sixty-one percent of men and 51% of women were overweight or obese. Consumption of red meat, refined grains, and whole-fat dairy was high, while that of fruits, non-tuberous vegetables, eggs, nuts and seeds, fish and poultry, and whole grains was low. Dairy and red meat were more consumed in summer and winter, respectively. Dietary inadequacy of 10 of 21 assessed nutrients, including fiber, folate, and vitamin D were >50% prevalent, while protein, zinc, and vitamin B12 inadequacy were low. Biochemical evidence of iron and vitamin A deficiency was also low. Three dietary patterns (Urban, Transitional, Nomadic) explained 41% of variation in food consumption. The Urban pattern was positively associated with BMI in multivariate analysis. (4) Conclusions: Results indicate a high prevalence of key dietary inadequacies and overweight among Mongolian adults. Prior studies by our group have suggested that expanded supplementation and food fortification would be effective in addressing micronutrient inadequacies; these strategies should be coupled with measures to mitigate the growing burden of chronic disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284332/pdf/nutrients-12-01514.pdf

We used 3-day food diaries to assess maternal diet and performed principal component analysis to identify dietary patterns. Maternal adherence to a traditional pattern, which was characterized by a higher intake of tubers, vegetables, fruits, red meat, and rice, was associated with a higher probability of EGWG (quartile 3 vs. quartile 1, odds ratio [OR] = 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.38).

Relatively few studies have combined in-store food availability measures with geographic mapping of stores. We review research that has used these multi-dimensional measures of access to explore the links between the neighborhood food environment and consumption or weight status. Early research in California found correlations between red meat, reduced-fat milk, and whole-grain bread consumption and shelf space availability of these products in area stores. Subsequent research in New York confirmed the low-fat milk findings. Recent research in Baltimore has used more sophisticated diet assessment tools and store-based instruments, along with controls for individual characteristics, to show that low availability of healthy food in area stores is associated with low-quality diets of area residents. Our research in southeastern Louisiana has shown that shelf space availability of energy-dense snack foods is positively associated with BMI after controlling for individual socioeconomic characteristics. Most of this research is based on cross-sectional studies. To assess the direction of causality, future research testing the effects of interventions is needed. We suggest that multi-dimensional measures of the neighborhood food environment are important to understanding these links between access and consumption. They provide a more nuanced assessment of the food environment.

This cross-sectional study, using a survey questionnaire, evaluated 1212 Southern Californian adolescents' self-reported PA, BMI and food frequency. Results revealed that even though males are more active than females, they have higher BMI percentile values (p < 0.05).

Obesity, consumption of red meat, a Western pattern diet, alcohol, and smoking influence one's risk of developing colorectal cancer while physical activity, vitamin D, postmenopausal estrogen use, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease one's risk. Until recently, it was largely unknown if any of these modifiable factors influence the outcomes of patients already diagnosed with colorectal cancer. However, data are emerging of factors that may influence disease recurrences and mortality for colorectal cancer survivors. Prospective observational studies have shown that increased exercise after diagnosis and avoidance of a Western pattern diet are associated with reduced risk of cancer recurrence and improved overall survival in early-stage colorectal cancer after standard therapy. Patients with class II and III obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥35 kg/m(2)) have a modestly increased risk of recurrence. Regular use of aspirin or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors decrease recurrence rates and increase serum vitamin D levels.
